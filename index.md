## <span style="color: orange;">Why I'm doing CSP</span>
I have been doing coding for the past year, and I have slowly fallen down into the rabbit hole that is coding. From doing USACO to writing small and simple projects such as a calculator, I have enjoyed coding things more and more. I'm taking CSP to learn how to think more like a coder and advance my skills in working with others and problem-solving.
