## <span style="color: red;">Problems I ran into (Week 0)</span>

- Pip functions did not run and python was not found on my computer even though I installed python. It would still not work even when I uninstalled/reinstalled python. I had to troubleshoot with my partner and rule out potential errors that could have caused this bug. In the end, I found out that I needed to add a 3 to the end of the commands (pip3 and python3). Without my partner, I wouldnt't have figured out the bug for a lot longer.

- Even though I followed all the installation steps and followed the debugging steps Mr. Mortenson showed everyone, I got a markdown error where markdown wasn't found in some specific files. I tried to reinstall markdown and other installations, but I still got the same error. I went to my partner for assistance, but both of us were stumped by the error code. Finally, when we googled the error, I fell into a stack overflow rabbit hole. In this rabbit hole, I finally found some commands that would reinstall markdown properly, and I was finally able to run my servers.
