## CollegeBoard test
- Focused on the expected output of certain code blocks
- Had questions relating to electronics and the internet
  - IP Adress
  - Security
  - Storing data in bits

## Questions I got wrong
- Choose the pseudo code that correctly gets you to the end goal
  - I got this question wrong because I read the pseudo code wrong, causing the resulting output of my choice to be wrong. 
-  Given psuedo code, see how long it will take to run
  - Because I only focused on the code that was being repeated, I failed to look at the code outside the loop, causing me to get the incorrect answer.
- See how the count of prey changes over time
  - Because I didn't read the question carefully, I missed the fact that a certain function didn't change the amount of predators over time. This caused me to get the answer wrong.
- See what the safest option is to sample music
  - I got this question wrong because I didn't know how copyright worked for music, so the answer I got was wrong
- How would a program run based on the function?
  - I got this question wrong because of my lack of knowledge of time complexity. Computers can compute the square of a number very quickly, even big numbers. This would make the algorithm in the question run in reasonable time, making my answer wrong.
- How to manage the complexity of a problem using data abstraction
  - I got this question wrong because I didn't know the definition of data abstraction. This caused me to misinterpret the question, making me get it wrong.

## Pseudo Code
- Pseudo Code is a way to write code that is intuitive
  - = Sign represented by <-
  - print() is Display()
  - Loops are signified by "Repeat X times"
