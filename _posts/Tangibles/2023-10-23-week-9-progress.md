## What I learned working on the project
- Connecting frontend to backend can be very confusing
    - Use the API to show the data on frontend
- JSON Files store data in lists
    - Different items in the lists are stored as dictionaries
    - Dictionaries are the only things that can be stored in the list in a JSON file
