### Individual 
1. Given absolute freedom, I would code a project that could help me in day-to-day life. This would help me both learn how to code better and it would be applied to a real-world scenario. I would also try to code something that uses data from images, as I am very interested in learning how data from images is used.

2. I would be motivated to work/code every day if I could code something that is both interesting and challenging. This would encourage me to have fun and collaborate to solve difficult coding problems. 

3. I would measure success in our team by seeing the progress/amount of work done per week that helps us reach a certain goal. This measurement of success is based on the amount of effort put in, which can be used to see if the team is working consistently or not.

4. I will maintain motivation by having a unique project idea that everyone enjoys. This can be done by creating a project that is very interactive to users and also interesting to the team members. This can also be done by tackling interesting concepts such as dealing with different types of data and using different algorithms to create new features.
