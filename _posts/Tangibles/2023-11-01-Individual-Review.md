# Project Recap

## Issues Review
<a href="https://github.com/APCSP-RAGS/pp-frontend/issues/1">Issue Week 1</a>
In this first week, I designed the frontend to look like the blueprint: <a href = "https://www.canva.com/design/DAFwy_4sba8/hiUKhROCfCaWV4VkUUk_jw/edit">See Canva blueprint here.</a> We got the two pages for music generation/recommendation up. The main challenge was getting the input box to work, as that had a lot of bugs to it.

In the second week, we got the data table working for the jokes and songs API. I ran into a lot of problem, the main problem being the file format. I also updated the frontend design to include the alien world page.

In the 3rd week, I made major changes to the page with the moving character. I fixed many problems with the page with the moving character because of how the code was built. To fix this, I had to remake the code so that the character would rotate and not go through frames like a sprite.
