CPT Feature I contributed:
- Users can send messages and see other messages that were sent in the past
- Message gets sent to backend and is stored in the database forever
- Users can like messages and see the like count on any other message

Steps for personalization:
- Clean up frontend to make it easy to navigate
  - Add a button front login/sign-up
  - Make the messages nicer to look at
- Add a delete/edit button to each message only if the message was sent by the same user
- Add a reply function
