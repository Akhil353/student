## What I learned
- Data Abstraction
  - Variables: Key Words used to assign values to a certain key
  - Types of Variables: String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Array (Use type() function to get the type of a variable)
  - Mathematical Functions: Can be used for integers, floats, strings, and sometimes arrays too!
  - Variables can be used to define other variables
  - Lists can have multiple positions, each seperated by a ','
  - Use square brackets to get an index (Index starts at 0)
  - Classes
    - Classes are essentially a group of functions that are callable
