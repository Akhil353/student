# Journey
My experience with CollegeBoard practice MCQs has reinforced my understanding of various topics covered in the team teaches. These questions not only check knowledge but also encourage learning through testing the depth of understanding. The big pool of questions ensures a thorough review, and as I tackled each one, I looked up the questions I didn't know online, further expanding the knowledge I have of the internet. These MCQs serve as an effective study guide, revealing areas that I could study on more. Overall, even though it was long and boring at times, the CollegeBoard MCQ helped me learn a lot.

# Questions I got wrong

### Question 12
A color in a computing application is represented by an RGB triplet that describes the amount of red, green, and blue, respectively, used to create the desired color. A selection of colors and their corresponding RGB triplets are shown in the following table. Each value is represented in decimal (base 10).

Color Name	    RGB Triplet
indigo	        (75,   0, 130)
ivory	        (255, 255, 240)
light pink	    (255, 182, 193)â€‹
light yellow	(255, 255, 224)
magenta	        (255,   0, 255)
neutral gray	(127, 127, 112)
pale yellow	    (255, 255, 160)
vivid yellow	(255, 255,  14)
What is the binary RGB triplet for the color indigo?

- I got this question wrong because I tried to shortcut the conversion of the binary numbers and do it in my head. This resulted in me counting the binary value wrong, getting me the wrong answer. I plan to fix this mistake by practicing working with binary values more, which will further reduce the number of mistakes I make.

### Question 26
A list of binary values (0 or 1) is used to represent a black-and-white image. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be stored as metadata associated with the image?

- I got this question wrong because of the lack of understanding I have of what metadata is. Because of this, I made a false assumption on the correct answer, getting me the wrong answer. I plan to fix this mistake in the future by researching more about what metadata is and what data it stores on a certain object.

### Question 50
Consider the following algorithms. Each algorithm operates on a list containing n elements, where n is a very large integer.

1. An algorithm that accesses each element in the list twice
2. An algorithm that accesses each element in the list n times
3. An algorithm that accesses only the first 10 elements in the list, regardless of the size of the list
Which of the algorithms run in reasonable time?

- I got this question wrong because I underestimated the power of modern computers. Most modern computers are very complex, and can handle big numbers easily, so I ended up getting the question wrong. I plan to fix this mistake in the future by learning more about computers and how well they work.


# Reflection
Overall, I believe I learned a lot from this CollegeBoard MCQ, such as how to research topics you don't know about, how to gain a better understanding of information you already know, and how to prevent mistakes from happening in the future. With this information, I hope to prepare to learn more in the future and make less mistakes.
